# Python Reinforcement Learning Projects 
## Installation and environment:
[Github Repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Reinforcement-Learning-Projects) uses [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). This is needed for tensorflow 1.5 but out of date for gym, etc.
