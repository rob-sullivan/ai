# Python Reinforcement Learning Projects 
## Installation and environment:
* VS Code
* Download [Github](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Reinforcement-Learning-Projects), 
* Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) locally (don't add to path)
* using python 3.6 create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv rl_projects_venv
