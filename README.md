# 3d Deep Learning
## Installation
Install a Conda environment without installing the full Anaconda distribution, by using Miniconda, which is a lightweight version of Anaconda that only includes Conda and Python.

* python3 -m venv venv_3dl
* go to [pytorch's website](https://pytorch.org/) to find the correct install command e.g: pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
