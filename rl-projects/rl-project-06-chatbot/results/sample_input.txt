Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
