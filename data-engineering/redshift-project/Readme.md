# Redshift

# Why use Redshift

- Before we used to fetch data from a data warehouse where a lot of mainterannce was required (time consuming, maintenance cost was high, loss of information and data rigidity).
- Amazon redshift is a data warehouse service that is primarily used to store large chunks of data. It allows you to extract and analyse data using BI tools. It helps with handling large datasets.
- Instead of having things stored in different S3 buckets you can pull them in and store them in Redshift.
